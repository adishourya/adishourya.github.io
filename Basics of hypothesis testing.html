<p>
suppose there is a cholestrol test which predicts correct 99% of the time
and there are 100 people in the clinic
</p>

<p>
All ✓ : 100C₀ (0.99)^100 → 0.366
1 X 99 ✓ : 100C₁ (0.99)^99 x 0.01 → 0.37
and so on ..
</p>

<p>
hypothesis is this that my new test is accurate 99% time
</p>

<p>
Hypothesis is made on pop. not on the sample
</p>

<p>
H₀: no diff hypothesis ; statement of equality
H₁: news ; new discovery
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Suppose i run a website that currently has white background and i know μ
  amount of time people spent on the webite which is 20 min. Ideally i would
  want people to spend more time on my website for which i decide to change the
  background to a darker shade.But after the change how do i feel good about
  the change having the intended consequence?

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Well thats where significance test comes into play

</ul>

<p>
The next step would be to setup the hypothesis
</p>

<p>
μ₀ = mean amt of time people spent on white background ; μ₁ = mean amt of time
people spent on dark background
</p>

<p>
→ H₀: no change : μ₀ = μ₁
→ H₁: change : μ₀ &lt; μ₁
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Then we will setup  a significance level α
  α = 0.05 i.e 5%

</ul>

<p>
  now we will sample out people who have now started using the new website
  and calculate x_bar , s ...
</p>

<p>
  and see the likelyhood of drawing that sample
  if the likelyhood is less than 5% we could reject the null hypothesis
  else we would <span id="Idea Behind Hypothesis Testing-P-values &amp; significance test-fail"></span><strong id="fail">fail</strong> to reject null hypothesis
</p>

<ul>
<li>
suppose now we have drawn the sample of size =100 for which
  x_bar = 25 and s

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Now we would calculate P-value i.e probability value

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
P-value is the prob. of getting sample statistics (equally unlikely + rarer) given that H₀ is true

<li>
P-value → (x_bar≥25|H₀)
  P-value &lt; α : we could reject null hypo
  P-value &gt;= α : <span id="Idea Behind Hypothesis Testing-P-values &amp; significance test-fail"></span><strong id="fail">fail</strong> to reject null hypo

</ul>

<p>
where α and β are
α ==    prob of making a type 1 err
β ==    prob of making a type 2 err
</p>

<p>
Why is Type I error = α ?
→ There is a 0.05 % chance of getting a sample which is rare enough to reject H₀

<p>
A poll showed an unemployement rate of 9% . So the mayor conducts a poll of her
own to see if it's different than 9%
</p>

<p>
Here are the hypothesis
H₀: p = 0.09
H₁: p ≠ 0.09
</p>

<ol>
<li>
when would the mayor make a type 1 err ?

<li>
when would she make a type II err ?

</ol>

<p>
Ans :
</p>
<ol>
<li>
to accept H₁ even when H₀ was true.

<li>
2) to accept H₀ even when H₁ was true

</ol>

<p>
Power = <em><span id="Idea Behind Hypothesis Testing-Intro to power of significance-Probability of correctly rejecting H₀"></span><strong id="Probability of correctly rejecting H₀">Probability of correctly rejecting H₀</strong></em>  → P(reject H₀|H₀ is false)
</p>

<p>
it could also be seen as
Power = 1 - incorrectly rejecting H₀
Power = 1 - P(not reject H₀|H₀ is false)
Power = 1 - P(Type II) = 1 - β
