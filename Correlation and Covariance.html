<em>Properties</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The value of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1 and 1.

<li>
The greater the absolute value of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, the stronger the linear relationship.

<li>
The strongest linear relationship is indicated by a correlation coefficient of -1 or 1.

<li>
The weakest linear relationship is indicated by a correlation coefficient equal to 0.

<li>
A positive correlation means that if one variable gets bigger, the other variable tends to get bigger.

<li>
A negative correlation means that if one variable gets bigger, the other variable tends to get smaller.

</ul>


<p>
NOTE : a correlation of 0 does not mean zero relationship between two variables; rather, it means zero linear relationship.
(It is possible for two variables to have zero linear relationship and a strong curvilinear relationship at the same time.)
