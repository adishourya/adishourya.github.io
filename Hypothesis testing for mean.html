Regulations require milk containers to have 128 fluid ounces and the milk
processor is said to be in compliance with that . Variability in the filling
process is normal A random sample of size 12 was drawn and the test stat were
x_bar = 127.2 fluid ounce and dev = 2.1 ounce Is there sufficient evidence that
the packaging plant is not in compliance with the regulations
</p>

<p>
soll:
let significance level α be 5%
H₀ : μ = 128 foz
H₁ : μ &lt; 128 foz
</p>

<p>
Req:
orig sample : var normally dist ✓
Randomly dist. ✓
assuming plant makes more than 120 bottles : 12 ≤ 10% * (&gt;120) ✓
</p>

<p>
Test stat
x_bar = 127.2
sx = 2.1
</p>

<p>
t_abs = ( 128 - 127.2) / ( 2.1 / √12 )
t_abs = 1.32
</p>

<p>
calculate p_value
</p>

<pre python>
import scipy.stats as st
# n = sample_size
p_val = st.t.sf(abs(t_val),n-1) # for one sided
p_val = st.t.sf(abs(t_val),n-1) # for two sided
</pre>

<p>
Result : p_val =  10.68 %
since p_val &gt; 5% (α)
failed to reject H₀
Ans : There is not sufficient evidence that the plant is not in compliance with regulatory standards.
