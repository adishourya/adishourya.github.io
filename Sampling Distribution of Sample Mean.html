<ul>
<li>
The central limit theorem states that if you have a population with mean μ
  and standard deviation σ and take sufficiently large random samples from the
  population with replacement , then the distribution of the sample means will
  be approximately normally distributed.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample
  means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger — no
  matter what the shape of the population distribution.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
This fact holds especially true for sample sizes <span id="Central Limit Theorem-≥30"></span><strong id="≥30">≥30</strong>.

<li>
If the population is normal, then the theorem holds true <span id="Central Limit Theorem-even"></span><strong id="even">even</strong> for samples smaller <span id="Central Limit Theorem-≤30"></span><strong id="≤30">≤30</strong>

</ul>

<div id="Standard Error"><h2 id="Standard Error" class="header"><a href="#Standard Error">Standard Error</a></h2></div>

<ul>
<li>
s is also known as standard err.

<li>
where s is the standard dev. of the sample dist. of sample mean

</ul>


<p>
What happens when you increase the sample size ,
when making a sample dist of sample mean ?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
the dist. looks more and more normal

<li>
and the σ decreases

</ul>

<p>
see : <a href="/home/adi/Documents/my-notes/standard_err_1.png">file:standard_err_1.png</a>
</p>

<p>
so if we know the σ of the population
we could find the standard deviation of the sample

Example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The avg. male drinks 2L of water with std. deviation of 0.7L . You are
  planning a full day trip with 50 men and bring 110L of water . what is the
  chance that you will run out of water ?

</ul>

<dl>
<dt>sol </dt>
<dd>we know pop. parameter → μ = 2L , σ = 0.7</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
sample size (n) = 50 ; water/person = 110/50 = 2.2
→ so anything above 2.2 would mean running out of water
→ and the s of sample dist of sample mean would be
s = σ /√n = 0.7/√50 = 0.099 , and mean of the sample dist. of
sample mean would be the same as pop mean.
