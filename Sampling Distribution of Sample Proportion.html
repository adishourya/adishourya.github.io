shape of sample dist.
There are 2 rules of thumb to see if sample dist of sample prop is normal
</p>
<ul>
<li>
np ≥ 10

<li>
nq ≥ 10

</ul>

<p>
eg1 : <a href="/home/adi/Documents/my-notes/sample_dist_prop1.png">example 1</a>
	→ in this problem n = 50 ; p = 0.12
	→ so for the sample dist. of sample prop. np = 6 ≤ 10 ∴ not normal
	→ now the mean of sample dist of sample prop = p . which is 0.12
	→ so the graph is skewed to the right
</p>

<p>
eg2 : <a href="/home/adi/Documents/my-notes/sample_dist_prop2.png">example 2</a>
	→ if true pop proportion is not given ;
	the best assumption is the sample prop
	→ here the true prop (p) = 0.15 ; n = 160
	→ np &amp; nq ≥ 10 ∴ normally distributed sample dist.
	→ x_bar = p = 0.15 &amp; s = √(pq/n) = 0.02823

According to the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey, 87,
percent of Americans over the age of 25 have earned a high school diploma.
Suppose we are going to take a random sample of 200 Americans in this
age group and calculate what proportion of the sample has a high school
diploma.
</p>

<p>
What is the probability that the proportion of people in the sample
with a high school diploma is less than 85, percent?

</p>

<p>
Question A (Part 1)
What is the expected number of people in the sample with a high school diploma?
</p>

<p>
x_bar = np = 200 x 0.87 = 174
</p>

<p>
ANS:174 people
</p>

<p>
Question B (Part 1)
What is the expected number of people in the sample without a high school diploma?
Ans:26 people
</p>

<p>
Question C (Part 1)
Is the sampling distribution of p_hat on top approximately normal?
<dl>
<dt>soll </dt>
<dd>np = 174 &amp;&amp; nq = 26 ≥ 10 ∴ normally distributed</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Ans :Yes ✓ / No

<p>
What is the mean of the sampling distribution ?
Ans : 0.87
</p>

<p>
What is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution ?
σ = √(pq/n) = 0.02378
