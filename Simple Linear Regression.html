y_hat = β0 * x + β1

<dl>
<dt>where </dt>
<dd>β0 = r * (σy / σx)</dd>
</dl>
<p>
now if we know β0 we can calculate β1
</p>
<ul>
<li>
as we know for a least squared reg line must pass through (μx , μy)

</ul>

<p>
μy = r*(σy/σx) + β1

<ul>
<li>
why bother making a residual plot ?

</ul>

<dl>
<dd>The general idea is if you see the points pretty evenly</dd>
</dl>
<p>
scattered above and below the line (x-axis of resid plot)
and dont really discern with a trend . Maybe a linear model may not
be the best answer. Maybe a non-linear model would work better

<ul>
<li>
in a way,r, squared measures how much prediction error is eliminated when we use least-squares regression.

<li>
comapred to the worst trend line which would be r(correlation coefficient) = 0.

<li>
y_hat = r*(sy/sx) *x + c | @r=0 ⇒ y_hat = c

<li>
now a trend line always passes through y_avg and x_avg .substituting

<li>
gives us y_hat = y_avg

</ul>

<dl>
<dt>  </dt>
<dd>how much % squared err was removed compared to y_avg</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>  </dt>
<dd>  r² = err₁ - err₂ / err₁</dd>
</dl>

<p>
where err₁ = squared err of trend line
where err₂ = squared err of y_avg line
</p>

<p>
Many formal definitions say that
 r, squared tells us what percent of the variability in the y variable is
 accounted by the regression line

<ul>
<li>
When our model we have multiple independent variables, we use Adjusted
  R-Squared instead of R-Squared value for model evaluation.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Because when we have more independent variable in R-Squared
  calculation(weather they are correlated or not correlated), R-squared value
  automatically get increased due to slope coefficient value.  R Squared
  Formula

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
In Adjusted R-Squared calculations, it penalizes the independent variables
  which are not correlated to the dependent variable. So there is no impact of
  independent variable which are not correlated to dependent variable. So in
  our Multiple Regression cases we use Adjusted R square for model accuracy
  check instead of R-Square.

</ul>
