<p>
Like in diff of prop
diff of mean would be done as
</p>

<p>
(x_bar1 - x_bar2) ± t* σ₁₂
now dev would be calculated as expected
sample dev of sample / √n
</p>

<p>
and t* would be determined by significance level
dof for t* would be min (n₁ - 1 , n₂ - 1)
</p>

<p>
kyle suspects that when people exercise more their body temp changes
group1 exercised for 30 mins : n1 = 18 ; x_bar1 = 38.3 ; s1 = 0.27
group2 exercised for 60 mins : n2 = 24 ; x_bar1 = 38.9 ; s1 = 0.29
</p>

<p>
construct a 90% ci 60-30
</p>

<pre python>
import scipy.stats as st
# a 90% ci would have 5% on either side
# dof = min(n1-1,n2-1)
t_crit = st.t.ppf(0.95,df=17)
# t_crit = 1.739
</pre>

<p>
0.6 ± 1.74 (√((0.27 / 18)+ (0.29/24)))

<div id="Paired T-test &amp; 2 Sample T-test"><h1 id="Paired T-test &amp; 2 Sample T-test" class="header"><a href="#Paired T-test &amp; 2 Sample T-test">Paired T-test &amp; 2 Sample T-test</a></h1></div>

<p>
In a Paired T-test
for each member of pop. (same pop) you have test statistic of the same variable
for e.g do people run fast in shorts or in pants ?
</p>
<blockquote>
for the sampe pop you have pairs of speed
</blockquote>

<p>
In 2 -sample T-tets
you will have 2 different pop.
for e.g salary diff of men and women
