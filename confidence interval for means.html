Just like prop a c.i for means can be constructed
with x_bar ± ẕ * σ/√n (for mean)
but we most likely dont know σ so we could approx it with sample statistic as s
i.e x_bar ± Ẕ * s/√n  but it turns out this actually underestimates the interval
so statistician built a t table .

Conditions for valid t intervals (c.i with t-table)
</p>
<ol>
<li>
random sample

<li>
normal condition (if sample size ≥ 30 or sample size ≤ 30 but pop is normal
   or just symmetric is enough some times)

<li>
sampling with replacement (rarely happens) or sample size is 10% of pop

</ol>

paired sample : treat these problem similarly as above
</p>
<ul>
<li>
perform it on difference

in some studies, we make two observations on the same individual. For instance,
we might look at each student's pre-test and post-test scores in a course. In
other studies, we might make an observation on each of two similar individuals.
For example, some medicine trials involve pairing similar subjects so one
receives the medicine and the other receives a placebo.

<p>
In both types of studies, we're working with paired data, and whenever we're
working with paired data, we're typically interested in the difference between
each pair—for example, the difference between the pre-test and the post-test
data, or the difference between the medicine and the placebo data.
