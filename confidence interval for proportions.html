→ Suppose a sample is drawn from a pop of 100 . And the sample's prop is p_hat
= 0.54 . Build a 95% confidence level

std_err = σ_phat = √pq/n = √(0.54*0.46/100) = 0.047
95% c.i = p_hat + 2 S.E ≤ P ≥ p_hat + 2S.E == 0.54 - 2*0.047 ≤ P ≥ 0.54 + 2*0.047

<li>
Assuming sample dist of sample prop is normal :: shape of sample dist.

</ol>
<p>
There are 2 rules of thumb to see if sample dist of sample prop is normal
</p>
<ul>
<li>
np ≥ 10

<li>
nq ≥ 10

</ul>
<li>
Independence rule. i.e sampling with replacement can be assumed if sample
   size ≤ 10% of pop size

to get 94% c.i . there would be 3% on either side of the tail
however z table gives the area covered from -∞ .
so on a ẕ-table it would be equivalent to get z value which covers 97% of the area.

→ Della has over 500 songs on her phone and she wants to estimate what prop of
songs are by a female artist . she takes a sample of 50 songs and finds 20 are
by a female artist . Based on this sample she wants a c.i of 99 %

Let's see if req's are met to gen a c.i
</p>
<ol>
<li>
random sample ✓

<li>
np = 50 x 0.4 , nq = 50 x 0.6 ≥ 10 ✓

<li>
50 ≤ 10 % 500 ✓

</ol>

<p>
p_hat = 20/50 = 0.4
s.e = √pq/n = √(0.4 x 0.6 / 50)

</p>
<ul>
<li>
a 99% c.i will leave 0.5 % on either side of the tail

<li>
equivalent to 99.5 % in z table

<li>
which is around ~2.58

</ul>

<p>
Ans : 0.4 ± 2.58 √(0.4  x 0.6 / 50)
