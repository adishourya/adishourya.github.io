<ol>
<li>
Cross validation allows us to compare different machine learning methods and
   get a sense of how well they will work in practice

</ol>

<ol>
<li>
 Usually in ML the dataset is divided into a training set and a testing set
    But this set is chosen randomly .

</ol>

<ol>
<li>
A key challenge with machine learning in general, is that we canâ€™t know how
   well our model will perform on new data until we actually test it.

<ul>
<li>
To partition the data into a number of subsets say n

<li>
Hold out a set at a time and train the model on remaining set i.e n-1

<li>
Test model on hold out set

<li>
Repeat for all such sets (n times).

<li>
And in the End it gives all the (n) scores.

<li>
Average the result and choose the preferred model.

</ul>

<span id="HELPS TO DETERMINE WHICH ML LEARNING STRATERGY WOULD BE BEST-Stratified Technique"></span><strong id="Stratified Technique">Stratified Technique</strong> :: In this technique each such subset would have the
   same proportion of the data .  For e.g if the dataset has 80% male and the
   rest female.  Then all such subset would have 80% male and 20% female.
