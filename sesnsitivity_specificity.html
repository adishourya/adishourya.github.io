<p>
A confusion  matrix for 2 outcomes looks as such
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>
&nbsp;
</th>
<th>
Actual Positive
</th>
<th>
Actual Negative
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>
Predicted Positive
</th>
<th>
TP
</th>
<th>
FP
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>
Predicted Negative
</th>
<th>
FN
</th>
<th>
TN
</th>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Once the confusion matrix is filled out we can calculate 2 useful matrix sensitivity and specificity
</p>

<p>
∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙
<dl>
<dt><span id="-Sensitivity"></span><strong id="Sensitivity">Sensitivity</strong> </dt>
<dd>Tells us what percentage of patients with heart disease were</dd>
</dl>
correctly classified . (i.e the first col.)
</p>

<p>
Sensitivity = True Positive / Actual Positive
∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙
<dl>
<dt><span id="-Specificity"></span><strong id="Specificity">Specificity</strong> </dt>
<dd>Tells us what percentage of patients without heart disease</dd>
</dl>
were correctly classified
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Specificity </dt>
<dd>True Negative / Actual Negative</dd>
</dl>
<p>
∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙
</p>

<p>
Calculating Sensitivity and specificity for 2 rows and 2 cols is straight forward
so lets try calculating it for 3 rows and 3 cols
In such case sensitivity and specificity are calculated for each category
</p>

<p>
For e.g lets say people have different opinions on the game C.S → Good , Meh , Dead Game
There are diff predictors for such opinions such as age , gender , country .
Our models perfomance can be seen in the confusion matrix below.
</p>


<table>
<tr>
<td>
&nbsp;
</td>
<td>
Actually Good
</td>
<td>
Actually Meh
</td>
<td>
Actually Dead
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Predicted Good
</td>
<td>
12
</td>
<td>
102
</td>
<td>
93
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Predicted Meh
</td>
<td>
112
</td>
<td>
23
</td>
<td>
77
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Predicted Dead
</td>
<td>
83
</td>
<td>
92
</td>
<td>
17
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
lets say 1 → Good , 2 →  Meh , 3 → Dead
</p>



<div id="VISUALLY AID → ALWAYS TRY TO KEEP VARIABLE TO LEFT AND PERFORM AS IF IT WERE 2 DIMENSIONAL"><h4 id="VISUALLY AID → ALWAYS TRY TO KEEP VARIABLE TO LEFT AND PERFORM AS IF IT WERE 2 DIMENSIONAL" class="header"><a href="#VISUALLY AID → ALWAYS TRY TO KEEP VARIABLE TO LEFT AND PERFORM AS IF IT WERE 2 DIMENSIONAL">VISUALLY AID → ALWAYS TRY TO KEEP VARIABLE TO LEFT AND PERFORM AS IF IT WERE 2 DIMENSIONAL</a></h4></div>
<blockquote>
Actual →
</blockquote>
<p>
P        |----|----|
R        | tp | fn |
E        | fp | tn |
D        |----|----|
↓
</p>

<p>
Sensitivity₁ = True Positive for Good / Actual Positive for Good (correctly classified 1)
12 / 12 + 112 + 83
12 / 207
0.0579
</p>

<p>
Specificity₁ =  True Negative For Good / Actual Negative for Good
now , this needs patience
True Negative = bottom right should be true negative =209
Actual Negative = True Negative + False Positive
False Positive =  195
Actual Negative = 209 + 195 = 404
</p>

<p>
= 209 / 404
</p>

<p>
And so on ...
But more importantly when to choose which metric
</p>
<ol>
<li>
If correctly classifying positive (in cases of hospital) is more imp. choose sensitivity

<li>
If correctly classifying negative (in cases of insurace) is more imp. choose specificity.

</ol>
