<p>
Nothing much to see here
There is a tradeoff between bias and variance
checkout : <a href="/home/adi/Documents/my-notes/bias_variance.png">bias_variance</a>
</p>

<p>
as the degree of the curve fit increases variance increases and bias decreases
as the degree of the curve fit decreases variance decreases and bias increases
</p>

<p>
for .eg since a straight line would fail to be best fit
as it would have low variance (low degree) and high bias (not all the points could pass through)
</p>

<p>
There are some commonly used methods for finding the sweet spot
like regularization , boosting and bagging
